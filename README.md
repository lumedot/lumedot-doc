# notebook.lumedot.com

This repo powers [notebook.lumedot.com](https://notebook.lumedot.com), a living page for experiments, drops, and documentation built by the team behind lumedot.
This repo was primarily built and maintained by **jheelee21**, who shipped most of this during Solana Break Out Hackathon while also pretending sleep was optional.

### 🔭 Purpose

This site was first created as the public welcome space for our participation in the Solana Break Out Hackathon. It serves as an open surface to share builds, updates, and signals as we explore on-chain publishing.

Later on, this will evolve into the core documentation hub for lumedot—covering everything from platform mechanics to creator tools to how we’re rebuilding book infrastructure from the ground up.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 
- Tailwind CSS  

### 🧠 Philosophy

It’s where we’ll write down what we’re doing *as we do it.*
